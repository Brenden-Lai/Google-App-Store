# Google-App-Store Project

SCENARIO: Exploring an older Google App Store dataset from Kaggle which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps?select=googleplaystore.csv) 
to learn more about the popular and unpopular apps found to practice and demonstrate SQL skills.  

Explored various questions that were interesting to me with the data that was provided which included several columns: App, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Type, Price, Content Rating, Genres, LastUpdated, Current Ver, and Android Ver 
as well as another table which included several columns: App, Translated_Review, Sentiment, Sentiment Polarity, and Sentiment Subjectivity.
